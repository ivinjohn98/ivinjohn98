## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About ME!

I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Texas A&M, where my research focuses on designing efficient streaming algorithms. My passion for algorithms and their complexity drives my academic journey as I aim to develop innovative solutions that can shape the future of computing.

Having spent significant time in the software industry as a backend developer at Tesco Bengaluru, I have had the opportunity to work with technologies like Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, Kafka, ElasticSearch, Couchbase, and Microsoft Azure. This hands-on industry experience has given me a unique perspective on computer science, allowing me to approach my research from practical and real-world angles.

I am passionate about applying my research skills to solve real-life problems and bridge the gap between theory and application. My goal is to design solutions that advance the field of computer science and have a tangible impact on industries and society as a whole.
